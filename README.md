### `npm start`

i believe you guys know how to run a react.js file

there are certain things i could have done better, i could have added a state that shows up when data is loading, or when data loading has failed.
i could have added a timer for expiration of data in the local storage.
but i believe my html and css skills as well as my react skills are more than up to par, and i believe that it shows in my work, i've been creating UI for more than 5 years now.

I hope my work was up to your standards, and i know i'll be considered for the job
